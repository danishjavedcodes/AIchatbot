**Personalized Chatbot for Eziline**
This is a personalized chatbot designed to assist users with inquiries related to Eziline, a software development and IT consulting company. The chatbot is capable of answering common questions about Eziline using predefined responses. Additionally, it leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to generate responses for new and unique queries.

**How It Works**
The chatbot utilizes a knowledge base of predefined questions and answers about Eziline. It matches user input against the predefined questions and provides corresponding answers if a match is found. If the user input does not match any predefined questions, the chatbot employs the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model to generate a response based on the conversation history.

To ensure the security of sensitive information, such as API keys, it is important to keep the code and associated files private and not share them with anyone.

**Setup and Configuration**
To run the chatbot locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.
Obtain an API key from OpenAI and update the openai.api_key variable in the code with your API key.
Run the code in a Python environment.

**Usage**
Once the chatbot is running, you can interact with it by typing your queries or messages. The chatbot will respond with relevant information about Eziline or provide assistance based on the conversation history. You can exit the chatbot by typing "bye".

_Please note that this chatbot is designed specifically for Eziline and may not be suitable for other use cases without appropriate modifications._
**Security and Privacy**
Ensure that the code, including any API keys or sensitive information, is kept private and not shared with unauthorized individuals. This helps protect the confidentiality and security of the chatbot and the associated data.
